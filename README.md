# CW_FinalAssignment
This project is the final Assignment of the CW1403 and it has written using LaTeX(with an online compiler).
Since this project uses an online LaTeX compiler it doesn't have too many commits.

I've wrote about 3 titles in this project:

1- Git and GitHub
There are some explanations about how I set up to start this project.

2- Explorating tasks
This section includes 3 things:
  1. Some Vim advanced features (including global commands, advanced search and text objects)
  2. Memory profiling (Memory leak and Valgrind)
  3. GNU/Linux Bash Scripting (fzf and Zathura)

3- Git and Foss
